She (6F) wanted to play fortnite (released 2017 by Epic Games) on my (237,624 M) Xbox One X (released 2017) even though she (6 F) has a PS4 (released 2013), which I (237,624 M) destroyed. I (237,624 M) said no. She (6 F) hit me. So naturally, I grabbed my Unholy Hellbringer (crafted 200,000 years ago in Neptune’s core by demons), and killed her. I also killed our 32 of our boys, being Liam (2 M), Noah (2 M), Elijah (2 M), Logan (2 M), Mason (2 M), James (2 M), Aiden (2 M), Ethan (2 M), Lucas (2 M), Jacob (2 M), Michael (2 M), Matthew (2 M), Benjamin (2 M), Alexander (2 M), William (2 M), Daniel (2 M), Jayden (2 M), Oliver (2 M), Carter (2 M), Sebastian (2 M), Joseph (2 M), David (2 M), Gabriel (2 M), Julian (2 M), Jackson (2 M), Anthony (2 M), Dylan (2 M), Wyatt (2 M), Grayson (2 M), Isaiah (2 M), Christopher (2 M), and Joshua (2 M). I saved Henry (2 M), because he (2 M) was my favorite child. I thought that he could be raised by wolves while i (237,624 M) played Fortnite (released 2017 by Epic Games) inside my house.

Many people, these days, are perfectly content with sitting on their computers all day playing video games. I used to be a competitive gamer and I used to do this. After joining the Greek system, partying became a new norm that was ingrained into my life. We need it for our wellbeing. It helps us escape society. There have even been studies that show how necessary gatherings are for our wellbeing. The fact that it was stripped away from us, especially by something that barely affects us specifically is very detrimental to our mental state.

I saw three small Fallen nearby, so I jumped up and activated Chaos Reach.\n\nBut as soon as I killed them, I stopped. Cancelled my super and just sat there. As if I was breaking out of a daze.\n\nThose three dregs were gone in an instant. They came and went before they even knew what hit them. They blinked and they missed their final moments. They never realized that some undead monstrosity came up behind them and unloaded its full cosmic power into them. I can't even remember if they were dregs.\n\nThose thoughts came to me in an instant and hit me hard. I turned off the game after that because the true scope of our power hit me then and there like a truck. All those years of the game telling me how strong we are did nothing. This small moment did it all.\n\nWe've killed Gods, Leaders, Rulers, and any number of insane threats. But after doing it so many times, we've forgotten the small threats. The small platoons of enemies that many in this universe would be afraid to be near, much less fight. But we aren't afraid. We don't even consider them a threat. We consider them a number. A tally.
